1.  How would you validate that a password has a length of six characters?

2.  How would you create a relationship where one Zombie has many Tweets and that a Tweet belongs to a Zombie?

3.  What does 'erb' stand for and how is it similar to handlebars?

4.  How is using ActiveRecord similar to your experience with MongoDB?  How is it different?
