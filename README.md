# Rails for Zombies

## Getting Started

*  Fork and clone this repo before starting on the challenges.

*  Go <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/" target="_blank">here</a> to complete all of the challenges.

*  Once you have finished all of the challenges create a observations.md file that describes what you learned by answering these questions:

    1.  How would you validate that a password has a length of six characters?

    2.  How would you create a relationship where one Zombie has many Tweets and that a Tweet belongs to a Zombie?

    3.  What does 'erb' stand for and how is it similar to handlebars?

    4.  How is using ActiveRecord similar to your experience with MongoDB?  How is it different?
